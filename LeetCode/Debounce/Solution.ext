Input: 
t = 50
calls = [
  {"t": 50, inputs: [1]},
  {"t": 75, inputs: [2]}
]
Output: [{"t": 125, inputs: [2]}]
Explanation:
let start = Date.now();
function log(...inputs) { 
  console.log([Date.now() - start, inputs ])
}
const dlog = debounce(log, 50);
setTimeout(() => dlog(1), 50);
setTimeout(() => dlog(2), 75);

The 1st call is cancelled by the 2nd call because the 2nd call occurred before 100ms
The 2nd call is delayed by 50ms and executed at 125ms. The inputs were (2).
