Input: reward1 = [1,1,3,4], reward2 = [4,4,1,1], k = 2
Output: 15
Explanation: In this example, the first mouse eats the 2nd (0-indexed) and the 3rd types of cheese, and the second mouse eats the 0th and the 1st types of cheese.
The total points are 4 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 15.
It can be proven that 15 is the maximum total points that the mice can achieve.
