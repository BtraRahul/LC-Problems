# Minimum Number of Flips to Make Binary Grid Palindromic II

Can you solve this real interview question? Minimum Number of Flips to Make Binary Grid Palindromic II - You are given an m x n binary matrix grid.

A row or column is considered palindromic if its values read the same forward and backward.

You can flip any number of cells in grid from 0 to 1, or from 1 to 0.

Return the minimum number of cells that need to be flipped to make all rows and columns palindromic, and the total number of 1's in grid divisible by 4.
