Input: nums = [2,3,7,9,3]
Output: 21
Explanation: We can apply the following operations on the array:
- Choose i = 0. The resulting array will be nums = [5,7,9,3].
- Choose i = 1. The resulting array will be nums = [5,16,3].
- Choose i = 0. The resulting array will be nums = [21,3].
The largest element in the final array is 21. It can be shown that we cannot obtain a larger element.
