Input: stones = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[2,2]]
Output: 5
Explanation: One way to remove 5 stones is as follows:
1. Remove stone [2,2] because it shares the same row as [2,1].
2. Remove stone [2,1] because it shares the same column as [0,1].
3. Remove stone [1,2] because it shares the same row as [1,0].
4. Remove stone [1,0] because it shares the same column as [0,0].
5. Remove stone [0,1] because it shares the same row as [0,0].
Stone [0,0] cannot be removed since it does not share a row/column with another stone still on the plane.
