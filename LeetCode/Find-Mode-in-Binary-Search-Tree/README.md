# Find Mode in Binary Search Tree

Can you solve this real interview question? Find Mode in Binary Search Tree - Given the root of a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, return all the mode(s) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(statistics)] (i.e., the most frequently occurred element) in it.

If the tree has more than one mode, return them in any order.

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

 * The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal to the node's key.
 * The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.
 * Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
